Humans always tend to find the most efficient way to get things done. Whether it’s getting from point A to point B or illuminating a room; we always try to find how to do it in a way that we don’t exert extra unnecessary work to achieve that goal. A lot of these typical tasks are shared by everyone; we all want to be able to travel to places as fast as possible, we all want to be able to have a source of light whenever it’s dark, and more. So why don’t we all come up with a common solution to these things that we can all share? 

That’s exactly what happened when Karl Benz invented the first automobile back in 1885 and Thomas Edison developed the first light bulb in 1879. They created a base solution that solved the common problems humans shared in their daily lives. Ever since then, improvements have been made to cars and light bulbs that now fit a more variety of people and also cater to more specific uses. However, they all tie back to the first invention that they still share deep to the core. 

Let’s take a look at cars; over the decades improvements have been made to improve the security, safety, and usefulness of cars. This led to many different types of cars being produced that catered towards specific jobs and people. Pick-up trucks were designed to transport heavy materials and be able to fit many things. Electric cars were designed to cut the use of gas and be more environmentally friendly. Sports cars were designed to cater towards people who seek the adrenaline rush of going fast and to get to a destination quickly. But no matter how different they are in terms of features and uses, they all share a common use that solves a common problem. Strip away all the fancy parts and what you get is the same base structure, functions, and mechanics. This is exactly what a design pattern aims to be. It solves a common problem to the best of its ability while still being able to be used in implementing specific use cases. 

Taking a look at our final project on our Covid chatbot and also other teams’ projects; we all used the same basics in all of our solutions. Stripping away the fancy interactions with our AI bot and nice user interface, you can see that it is a web application that uses meteor, react semantic ui and mongodb for our databases to store our information and to customize our webpage. This goes the same for the other projects found in the other teams. We all utilized the template that Johnson gave us and tweaked it to satisfy our own specific needs for our project and what we wanted to cater our project towards. It served us as a guide to pave the way for innovating ideas and new solutions.
