Before taking this class, I only worked with Javascript a little here and there at my job. I never really knew the rules and syntax of Javascript and never really put much effort into it. I thought it wasn't as efficient as other languages such as Java. However, when doing the exercises on freecodecamp for our assignment, I noticed differences between Javascript and Java that made a huge impression on me. A big difference that I really liked was that for Javascript, you don't need to specify the variable type whenever you're declaring a variable. For Java, you have to state whether the variable you're creating is an int, string, or another data type; but for Javascript you can just create a variable by just using let. This has made it easier for me to code because now I don't need to keep track of what data types my variables are. 

To me, I feel like Javascript is a very valuable language to learn in this professional world. From what I've seen, many software development jobs look for Javascript as one of the many languages they would want their applicant to know. Javascript can also be found everywhere since it can be used in front-end and also back-end. It is a widely used language in the programming world as it is capable of doing so much. 

Athletic software engineering could be very useful if you want to improve your time on programming problems and solutions. But as Philip mentioned, there are a ton of other benefits that athletic software engineering offers. By having a tight time limit on assignments and coding problems, this forces the student to practice their critical thinking and problem solving into practical use. Often at times, being put into some pressure helps people think better and also gives them motivation. However, it is also important not to over stress students and drive them into a corner. I feel that by using athletic software engineering to its best ability and to make sure not to over do it, it can improve student's problem solving skills.
