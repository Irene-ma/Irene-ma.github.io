What drew me into software engineering was the impact it had on people. Throughout these years, software applications have made life for us so much easier. From ordering items online to virtually attending classes, software has shaped humanity before we knew it. We have become reliant on software and the luxury it provides to us. What fascinated me about software engineering was the work people do to contribute to these applications and technology. Being able to contribute to these powerful tools that so many people rely on and use gives a feeling on accomplishment that I strived for. My interest in software engineering is to contribute to applications that are widely used around the world, from mobile development to web development. I want to be able to contribute to that and leave my mark in this world that will live on for generations.

I love working on applications knowing that many people will soon use them to their personal use. This gives me a sense of purpose that I'm impacting people’s lives from just a touch of their phone or a click from their mouse. During my internship at Hawaiian Airlines, I was put on a project to test the new flight status page on their website. I created several UI test cases that verified that the features on the web page worked correctly and were ready to be released to the public. This internship made me appreciate the hard work that people put into to make applications easy for the public to use. Being able to contribute to such a big change in the company made me feel accomplished and happy because only if I contributed only to testing the page, I indirectly impacted many people’s lives who use the Hawaiian Airlines website for their personal use by making sure everything worked for them. 

In the future, I hope to be able to contribute more in the software industry and impact the lives of many more people. I hope to work on implementing new features on applications that will pave way to new heights in the software industry. Being able to help people in the form of developing new technology makes me excited and motivated. It’ll be a satisfying experience when I look at an application later on and think to myself “I helped contribute to that”.
